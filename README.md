# PRONOM Research Week

After iPRES 2019 and with an eye on World Digital Preservation Day, we looked at ways we as a community to contribute to digital preservation efforts. We decided to focus on addressing gaps in PRONOM by organizing a PRONOM Research Week. During the week of 18-24 November, volunteers are encouraged to help with PRONOM’s research backlog. You can enhance documentation, supply sample files, or create a signature, among other things. 

We’re posting the PRONOM research backlog in a GitHub repository, which will also be the central location to share sample files and submissions. We also kindly ask for people to sign up via this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIbSJXSRZzDynoamzSbs_y592fmRFGLm0t2U5UHhdfA/edit#gid=0), so that people can coordinate. We’ve also posted some resources here, which include blog entries and webinars to help people learn more and get started.

# Submissions

For each submission, please include as much of the following information as possible. It’s okay if you don’t have everything, but please include what you can:

- PUID - if it exists already and you’re providing an enhanced description
- Extensions - any extensions known to be associated with the format
- MIME/Media Type - the MIME or Media Type associated with the format. This should be an official Media Type, either registered and listed via the IANA (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) or listed in official format documentation produced by the vendor
- Description - a concise, objective description of the file format.
- Format type - What type of format is it? (see below)
- Vendor (if known) - which vendor created the format? Which vendor currently supports it?
