Added:

CHLdev/2 Microsoft Works Drawing for Macintosh		4
CHLdev/3 Microsoft Works Word Processor Macintosh	2
CHLdev/4 Microsoft Works Spreadsheet for Macintosh	2
CHLdev/5 Microsoft Works Database for Macintosh		2

Unlike the Windows version of Microsoft Works, the Macintosh version 3 & 4 include a Drawing format.

Macintosh files from this time do not have extensions, none are added from the software. The extensions associated with existing PUID's are probably derived from the Windows version, but compatibility is unknown. No equivalent for Drawing format, left blank.

I am unclear what was intended for:
