http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Microsoft_Works

Adding signatures for the following:

* fmt/268	Microsoft Works Database for Macintosh		3	wdb Binary
* fmt/269	Microsoft Works Database for Macintosh		4	wdb OLE2 Container
* fmt/270	Microsoft Works Spreadsheet for Macintosh	3	wks Binary
* fmt/271	Microsoft Works Spreadsheet for Macintosh	4	wks OLE2 Container
* fmt/272	Microsoft Works Word Processor Macintosh	3	wps Binary
* fmt/273	Microsoft Works Word Processor Macintosh	4	wps OLE2 Container

Added:

* CHLdev/1 Microsoft Works Drawing for Macintosh		3 Binary
* CHLdev/2 Microsoft Works Drawing for Macintosh		4 OLE2 Container
* CHLdev/3 Microsoft Works Word Processor Macintosh	2 Binary
* CHLdev/4 Microsoft Works Spreadsheet for Macintosh	2 Binary
* CHLdev/5 Microsoft Works Database for Macintosh		2 Binary

Unlike the Windows version of Microsoft Works, the Macintosh version 3 & 4 include a Drawing format.

Macintosh files from this time do not have extensions, none are added from the software. The extensions associated with existing PUID's are probably derived from the Windows version, but compatibility is unknown. No equivalent for Drawing format, left blank.

I am unclear what was intended for:
x-fmt/5	Works for Macintosh Document	4
